# VS Code and Xdebug 3

If you use VS Code and want to use Xdebug, put the `launch.json` file herein
in the root of your site within a `/.vscode/` directory. This will help get Xdebug
running inside VS Code.

See [https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-with-vscode.html#getting-started](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-with-vscode.html#getting-started)
for more info.
