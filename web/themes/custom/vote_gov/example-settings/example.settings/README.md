# Drupal local settings files

These local settings and services files Weill help your local development
workflow by dialing caching, showing error messages and display twig
template debug output in web inspector.

Place these files in `docroot/sites/default`. Ensure that they do not get
committed to git.

For `example.settings.local.php`, rename it to `settings.local.php`
and that will connext to `local-dev.services.yml`
